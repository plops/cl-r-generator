Q: Given a gray scale image that shows a white wall with a black cupboard
infront, use threshold to select pixels belonging to the wall. Fit
thin plate spline. Show R code.

A: Sure! Here's an example R code that demonstrates how to use
thresholding to select pixels belonging to the white wall in a
grayscale image, and then fit a thin plate spline to the selected
pixels:

```r

# Load required packages
library(mgcv)  # For thin plate spline fitting
library(png)   # For reading and displaying images

# Read in the grayscale image
img <- readPNG("path/to/image.png", native = TRUE)

# Set threshold for wall pixels
threshold <- 0.5

# Select wall pixels using thresholding
wall_pixels <- ifelse(img < threshold, NA, img)

# Fit thin plate spline to wall pixels
tps_fit <- smooth.spline(wall_pixels, df = 100)

# Plot original image and selected pixels
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
image(img, main = "Original Image")
image(wall_pixels, main = "Wall Pixels")

# Plot thin plate spline fit
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(tps_fit, main = "Thin Plate Spline Fit")
```

In this example, the readPNG() function is used to read in the
grayscale image from a file. The ifelse() function is then used to
select pixels belonging to the wall based on the threshold value. The
resulting wall pixels are then used to fit a thin plate spline using
the smooth.spline() function from the mgcv package. Finally, the
original image and selected pixels are displayed using the image()
function, and the thin plate spline fit is plotted using the plot()
function.
